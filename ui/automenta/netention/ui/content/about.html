<p>
    Link the current and desired states of real and imaginary concepts – people, environments, objects, processes, knowledge, time, and much more.
</p>

<p>
    Netention is a tool for describing one’s current life situation (“is”), and potential future situations (“will be”)  – as linked data objects. A semantic description of a human life can be considered to consist of a set of declarations representing aspects about which one is concerned or interested.
</p>

<p>
    The network collects a community of people’s stories, and interweaves them by finding possible opportunities that are mutually inter-satisfying – essentially suggesting to its participants how they could realize the desired futures they have described.
